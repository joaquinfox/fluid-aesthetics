Considerations

Do I want to build this?
What is the opportunity?

 - does the CDN interface with a website? how?
 - if not, does it provide it's own customizable landing page? How does it support marketing efforts?
 
 - maybe they don't need a web page
 	- if the AR things has one,
 	- or if the AR thing means that a page integration will be bad or not possible
 	
- FIRST QUESTION: Do we really need and want a webpage.
   Yes they do. AR doesn't provide anything like that. It is more of an internal CRM.


- SECOND QUESTION: wordpress, next, or custom files?
	- well im building so ... what do i want to build in?
	 wp is a whole new thing i am not very interested in learning at the moment...
	 does AR link nicely to scheduling and a POS?
	 	- if so, then the web page is very simple
	 	- if not, and if we need any booking or sales or auth, then it is exponentially more difficult.
	 	NEXT QUESTION:
	 		- how does AR present scheduling and purchasing?
	 		- is it nice and simple?
	 			- the appointments thing is nice enough
	 				- can you link to it? TESTME
				- D told me sales would be in person, at location, using a phone app. so no POS.
				
		So no sales, login, scheduling function. The only thing needed is a nice UI for learning about the service and funneling to schedule
		
		DESIGN
		- PAGES
			- Products & services
			- FAQ
			- About us
			
	So its decided.
	I'll build it in next.js
	NEXT: 
	 - run locally
	 - create git project
	 - use for project management
	 
 So when you add a client in AR the system is supposed to send them a link to a scheduling app. Doesn't seem to work that well but ...
 This means that for a client to book an appointment they have to be added into the system allready...so it will not serve as a landing page. but a landing page cannot link to their scheduling app directly.
 
 uggestion: use AR as an inventory and document management tool but not as a scheduling tool
 
 Conversation with that team.
 AR limitations design implications
 - you can't have clients link straight to the AR scheduling app. You have to first create an account for the client, then the system generates messages etc.
 - so that can't be first contact
 - use calendly? 
 - use contact sheet?
 there is no interface with the AR thing. its just a dashboard, not a CRM.
